  Sugarizing MathGraph
 ======================

MathGraph requires MathGraph to run.
You can download the MathGraph activity from CeibalJAM! website:
http://activities.ceibaljam.org


1) Download MathGraph

You can download MathGraph from the following URL:
http://mathgraph32.org/spip.php?article69


2) Add Python code to show something when the activity is run

File "activity.py" has some code to show information to the user and
to check for Java availability.
The "images" folder contains images shown by the Python code.



3) Internationalization (i18n)

Reference for this section:
http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Python_i18n

cd $HOME/Activities/MathGraph.activity
# Create the local directories
mkdir -p locale/es/LC_MESSAGES
# Create the "po/MathGraph.pot" file:
./setup.py genpot
# Complete the first lines of the "po/MathGraph.pot" file with the version
# information, your e-mail, etc.
# Initialize a translation file for a given language (e.g. Spanish):
cd po
msginit -o es.po -l es
# The former command creates file "es.po", which should contain the Spanish
# translation. You may see some errors about a "team-address" file not found,
# but the translation file is created anyway.

Modify the "es.po" file to add the Spanish translations.
The command that builds the Sugar bundle will also create a "locale" folder
in the bundle folder containing the binary maps of the translations.

Make sure the charset in the ".po" file is UTF-8

The "locale" folder is automagically generated when the bundle is generated.
Thus, you will not see the translation or any changes made to it until you rebuild the bundle:
  ./setup.py dist_xo


4) The "sugarization" process required to add the following components to the PREFIX directory:

* "activity" folder
* "lib" folder (with required libraries to run sugarized activities)
* "bin/mathgraph-activity" script
* "etc" (for configuration files)
* "setup.py" script (to build an XO bundle)
* "activity.py" (startup PyGTK window)
* "images" (to display with the PyGTK startup window)
* "MathGraph32/MathGraph32Properties" (initial configuration)
